# Record-Collection
Record Collection
Code Explanation
First checks if value is a blank string. If so, then the key (prop) is removed from the object.
If that first check doesnâ€™t pass, it next checks if prop is equal to tracks. The tracks array is initialized if it does not exist, and then value is pushed into the tracks array. (This step uses shortcircuit evaluation)
If both these checks fail (meaning value is not an empty string and prop is not tracks), then either a new key (prop) and value (value) are added to the object, or an existing key is updated if the prop already exists.
